This is an implementation of the Dear Data Project showcasing my Screen time in a visual way. 
 
As the Turkish proverb goes: "Dağ ne kadar yüce olsa, yol üstünden aşar." (No matter how high the mountain, there is a path over it.)

I Have used the mountains and the sun to represent a new day, each day showing new opportunities, that come with their own hurdles, but being steadfast, it can be overcome. 
Each peak shows a different time spend on each category which could be utilised in a better way.

Overall, this project helped me understand the value of time, and how we simply don't realise how much time we waste on these screens, instead of gaining useful information and making precious memories with those around.
